# my-first-tdd
## Your Name(s):
### Huseyin & James
### What I/we have learned:
#### familiarise with git, understanding Jasmine, using tdd systematically. That case-sensitivity is important.
### What challenges I/we overcame:
#### Syntax errors. Curly brackets kept preventing the spec from running, took a while to figure it out but was an easy fix.
### What I/we struggled with:
#### Understanding how to use "it" "expect" "describe" "toEqual" and the syntax associated with it.
### What I/we would do differently next time:
#### Try the ping-pong method where one person codes the spec and other the application.
